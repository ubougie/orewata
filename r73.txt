Release 73

PS. I've lost release 72. If one of you happens to have a cached version for whatever reason, let me know.

PPS. To save myself a bit of time long term, I'll stop writing out Google and Bing.
Until I say otherwise, the first translation is google, the second is bing.
If I only write one translation, it is that they both gave the same translation.

PPPS. If anyone feels like hunting down the names for the people below (ie. Girl 1, etc.),
thanks, that would save me the effort.
Also, if you have a better idea of any of the translations below, let me know as well.

良がった

あたしガサツだから前も友達泣かしたことあって...!

自分勝手はわかってるけど

これから仲良くしてもらえますか...?

するよ! するする!

瑠海と二人で迷惑をかけてしまった人たちに謝ることにした

葵とそれと...


Machine Translation:

Good / It's good.

Because I'm gassatsu, my friend cried before ...! / I've cried my friend before because I'm a jerk...!

I know what I do / I know you're selfish.

Can you get along well ...? / Can you get along well from now on?

I will! I will! / I'll do it! To be!

I decided to apologize to Hon Hai and the people who bothered me / I decided to apologize to the people who caused trouble with Amami.

Aoi and it ... / Nagisa and that...


Ubo's Interpretation (lots of speculation here):

Aoi: I get it.

Aoi: Because I'm a jerk, I made my friends fight.

Rumi: No, I'm the one who's selfish.

Rumi: Can we get along from now on?

Aoi: Yes! For sure!

Narration: I decided to apologize to everyone.

Narration: Including Aoi.

ウチはー瑠海のためにー

なのにこんなことになるなんてー

私もごめんね

アキラもこれで納得した?

...うん!

納得いかねー!!!


Machine Translation:

Uchi-for the Bohai Sea / We're for the Sea of Amami.

But this is what happens / But i can't believe it's going to be like this!

I'm sorry too / I'm sorry, too.

Did Akira agree with this? / Was Akira convinced by this?

...Yup! / ... yes!

I'm not convinced !!! / I'm not convinced!!!.


Ubo's Interpretation (even more speculative than the last page; so far I've given you trash):

Girl 1 (I am bad with names): If it is ok with Rumi.

Girl 1: I'm sorry it has come to this.

Rumi: I'm also sorry.

Girl 2 (I told you, bad with names): How about you Akira, do you agree?

Akira: ...Yup!

Akira (thinking): Not really!
