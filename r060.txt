うちの親成洋服買ってくれるのはいいけどなんかうちの趣味じゃないのよね

わかる！私もお姉ちゃんのおさがりぱっかりで嫌になるよー

ちょっとトイレ

三浦さんはあっという間にうちらのグループに馴染んだ

正直三浦さんは苦手だ

皆は嫌ってないし…

オレの性格が悪いだけなのかな…？


Machine translation:

Shion: It's nice to buy my parent clothes but it's not my hobby / It's nice to buy my parents' clothes, but it's not my hobby, is it?

Rumi: Understand! I also hate my sister's descent / I understand! I'm going to hate my sister's back, too! 

Akira: Sorry, bathroom / Hey toilet

Narration: Miura quickly became familiar with our group.

Narration: Honestly Miura is not good / To be honest, Miura-san is not good at it.

Akira (thinking): Everyone doesn't hate ... / They don't hate it.

Akira (thinking): Is my personality just bad ...? / I wonder if it's just my bad character...?

Akira: I need to go to the bathroom

Narration: Miura-san quickly became familiar with our group (Miura san fit in our group in the blink of an eye)

Narration: Honestly, I am not good dealing with Miura-san

Akira (thinking): Everyone doesn't dislike her...

Akira (thinking): Or maybe I have poor personality...? (Akira using ore here)
