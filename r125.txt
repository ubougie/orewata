Bonus from twitter: How the names on the Aoi family plaque at their entrance are pronounced.

https://twitter.com/hatukisu/status/1331570971199750145

Aoi's family:
Father: Taiju
Mother: Tamao
Brother: Riku
Sister: Kouta

This tweet also draws attention to the "NNH", though I don't know what it refers to. But that Hatsuki is drawing attention to it makes me think it is some kind of easter egg.
