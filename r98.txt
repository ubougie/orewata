Narration: I forgot the time and danced


Interpretation:

Erika: Are we good at makeup or what?

Kikuchi: It's because you had a good base to work from!

Erika: Ew.

Kazuki: Hey, why don't we continue the rehearsal like this?

Kikuchi: Kazuki~

Kikuchi: Kazu-chan...

Kikuchi: Okay!

Rumi: Where were we?

Akira: The scene where the witch left.

Erika: Okay everyone!

Narration: The witch used magic to attire her with a pretty dress, as a way for her to go to the ball.

Ribbon girl: Turns out it's true. [ubo: ie. the rumour]

Narration: The prince and Cinderella

Tsukumo: Nice to meet you.

Akira: Likewise.

Narration: lost track of the time as they danced.

[ubo: For the "Nice to meet you" above, there is a double meaning.
Cinderella says this because she is meeting the prince for the first time.
But, parallel to this, there's another meaning, not for their roles in the play, but pertaining to Akira and Tsukumo directly.
This expression literally can mean "I leave myself in your care", or just a general sentiment of starting a new phase together.
It is speculative to read into this this second meaning, but imhikarucat also pointed out noticing it.]
