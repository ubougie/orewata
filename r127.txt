できた
I finished it!

意識して選ぶと恥ずかしいな・・・
Making these conscious decisions is embarrassing...

本編もやってみ
Try playing the main story too!

あたし女友達とこのゲームの話するのが夢だったんだよ！
I've always dreamed of having a girl friend to talk about this game with!

お前・・・そっちが本命だろ！
And you, you're the chosen one!

あたしの推し
I'm his fan.

この人決闘王の大会にお忍びで出たりしてるから
Since he has been secretly attending Duel-Oh! tournaments.

アキラも興味持てるかもよ
I thought you might be interested too, Akira.

葵も好きな人いるんだ・・・
So you have someone you like too, Aoi...

ー応あたしも女だからな
Please let me remind you, I too, am a girl.

あたしこんなんだから恋バナとかこっ恥ずかしくてできないからさ
Since I'm like I am, talking about love is embarrassing to me, and I just can't, you know?

今日ちょっとできて楽しかったよ
But being able to do it today was fun.

あとさ・・・
Also...

やっぱりアキラと／同じ学校に進学にしたい
I would love to go to the same school as Akira.

だから
So,

できる範囲でいいので勉強教えてください！
If it's okay with you, would you help me study, please?!

自分でも頑張るから
I'll do my best myself, so!

私なんかでよければ・・・
If you're okay with me...

あ　でもその代わりに・・・
Ah, but in return...
