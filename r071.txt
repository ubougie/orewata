アキラの気持ちなんて考えてなかった

好きなこと押し付けて

守った気になって...!

なんでも知ってるつもりになってた

けど藤木さんと知らない話で盛り上がってるの見て
私もわかってないことがあるんだって思ったら

そしたらどんどんこわくなってきて...
それで...

私…最低だ...


Machine Translation:

Rumi: (Google) I didn't think of Akira's feelings (Bing) I didn't think about Akira's feelings.

Rumi: (Google) Push what you like (Bing) Push me to do what I like.

Rumi: (Google) I feel like protecting ...! (Bing) I feel like I protected it...!

Rumi: (Google) I was supposed to know anything (Bing) I was going to know everything.

Rumi: (Google) But if you think that there is something I don't understand because I'm excited by an unknown story with Mr. Fujiki (Bing) But when I saw Fujiki-san and I'm excited about a story I don't know, I thought there were things that I didn't understand.

Rumi: (Google) Then it got more and more scary... So... (Bing) Then I became more and more scared... And...

Rumi: (Google) I ... the lowest ... (Bing) I... It's the worst...


Ubo's Interpretation:

Rumi: I wasn't concerned with your feelings.

Rumi: I would just push you to do anything I wanted.

Rumi: I felt like I was protecting you.

Rumi: That I was supposed to guide you through life.

Rumi: But when I saw you and Fujiki-san get excited about something I didn't understand, I realized there was more to you than what I taught you.

Rumi: I'm... the worst.
