藤みっ...!

ヒソヒソ

なに？

告白?

邪魔しちゃ悪いよ

行こうぜ

だって気になるじゃん

どけよ

バキッ

ありがとな藤宮おかげで小し気が楽になったよ

ああ...うん


Machine translation:

Tsukumo: Wisteria ...! / Mi Fuji ...!

SFX: Hisohiso / Hissohisso

Ribbon girl: What?

Ribbon girl: Confession? / Confess?

Other girl: It's bad to get in the way / I'm sorry to disturb you.

Tsukumo: Let's go

Ribbon girl: I'm worried / Because I'm worried about you.

Tsukumo: Go away / Get out of the way.

SFX: Baki / Bakik

Tsukumo: Thanks to Fujimiya for making me feel easier / Thanks to the good luck Fujimiya, I feel a little better.

Akira: Oh ... yeah / Oh... yes


Interpretation:

Tsukumo: Fujimi...!

SFX: *whisper*

Ribbon girl: What?

Ribbon girl: A confession?

Other girl: We can't interfere.

Tsukumo: Let's go.

Other girl: Because love is blooming!

Tsukumo: Get out of here.

SFX: *slam*

Tsukumo: Thank you Fujimiya, I feel a little bit better now.

Akira: Ah... Sure thing.


[ubo: It is premature to know the names of the two "new" girls on this page, since we don't have furigana, but we do know from previously related material the kanji for their names. Ribbon girl's name in kanji is 野木心愛 and the other girl's name in kanji is 村田朝陽. The first name in each case have a lot of variations, and I won't list them all out. But for the last names: ribbon girl's name (野木) is probably Nogi-san, and the other girl's name (村田) is almost certainly Murata-san.]

アキラって

一樹のこと好きなの?

なっ!?

なんでそうなる!?

ありゃ

津

それは...たまたま

アキラはイケメンが好きだから違うよー

Machine translation:

Natsumi: Akira / What's Akira?

Natsumi: Do you like Kazuki? / You like Kazuki?

Akira: What !? / What's that!?

Natsumi: Yes / Oh, my God.

Natsumi: No? / No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

Natsumi: Because I rarely talk to Akira boys but Kazuki is involved? / Because Akira, you hardly talk to a boy, but you're involved with Kazuki, aren't you?

Circle inside Natsumi bubble: Tsu

Akira: It happened ... / That is... By chance

Circle inside Akira bubble: A

Shion: Tsuda-chan!

Shion: Akira is different because he likes twink / Akira likes twink, so it's different.

Natsumi: What / What's going on?

Akira: Oh ... yeah / Oh, my God. yes


Interpretation:

Natsumi: So Akira

Natsumi: Do you like Kazuki? [ubo: Kazuki is Tsukumo's first name.]

Akira: Wha!?

Akira: What makes you think like that!?

Natsumi: Eh

Natsumi: Am I wrong?

Natsumi: Because, Akira, you hardly ever talk to boys, and yet aren't you getting close with Kazuki?

Akira: That... just sort of happened.

Shion: Tsuda-chan!

Shion: You're wrong, because Akira only likes handsome guys~ [ubo: Exclusively for the comic-walker edition, this is a callback to the lower middle panel of the first page of release 93. For the Twitter edition, this would sound like Shion is creating a rumour on the spot.]

Natsumi: What!

Akira: Uh... yeah.

Page Tw3/CW9

OCR:

たしかに男子が苦手であんまり絡んで来なかったけど

ちょっと話しただけで好きがどうとか...

男女ってそんなもんなの?

めんどくさい

アキラ

九十九くんのこと好きなの?

!?

[Tw3] だから何でそうなるの!?

[Tw3] いや気になるじゃん

[Tw3] 本当に違うの？

[Tw3] 違うって!

[CW9] だから違うっての!

[CW9] わかってるって

[CW9] でも九十九くんとなんかあった？

[CW9] なんかないとだめ...?


Machine translation:

Akira (thinking): Surely the boy was not good and he didn't get involved / I'm not good at boys, so I didn't get involved so much.

Akira (thinking): Just talking a little, but I like it somehow ... / Just talking a little bit and I don't know what you like.

Akira (thinking): Are men and women like that? / Is that what men and women are like?

Akira (thinking): Troublesome / Annoying

Rumi: Akira

Rumi: Do you like Kujuku-kun? / Do you like Kujuku-kun?

Akira: !?

[Tw3] Akira: So why is that ?! / So why does that happen!?

[Tw3] Rumi: No, I'm worried / No, it bothers me.

[Tw3] Rumi: Is it really different? / Are you sure it's not?

[Tw3] Akira: No!

[CW9] That's why it's different!

[CW9] I know / You know that.

[CW9] But did you have something with Kujuku-kun? / But what was it with 99-kun?

[CW9] I have to do something / What do we have to do?


Interpretation:

Akira (thinking): I know I'm not good at getting close to boys, but

Akira (thinking): Only by talking a little bit that means I like him or something?

Akira (thinking): Is that just the way it is between guys and girls?

Akira (thinking): How troublesome.

Rumi: Akira

Rumi: Do you like Tsukumo-kun?

Akira: !?

[Tw3] Akira: Why do you say that!?

[Tw3] Rumi: Oh, I am just curious.

[Tw3] Rumi: So, is that a no?

[Tw3] Akira: NO!

[CW9] Akira: You can't be serious!

[CW9] Rumi: Alright, I get it.

[CW9] Rumi: But, what happened with Tsukumo-kun?

[CW9] Akira (thinking): I have to say something.
