うん

もしかしてオレ...

すごく恥ずかしいかっこうしてる?

どっかで買えたりしないしないかな?

こんなんじゃ泳げないよ

スマホ...

ガサッ


Machine translation:

Akira: Sorry, bathroom ! / Hey Toy Les!

Rumi: Yup / Yes

Akira (thinking x 4): But ol ... / But Ol...

Akira: How embarrassing are you? / It's a great shame, but it's all right?

Akira: Can you buy it somewhere? / Can't you buy it somewhere?

Akira: I can't swim / Come on, you can't swim.

Aside: Smartphone ... Smartphone

Akira: !?

Akira: This... 

Akira: I got it in the morning ... / In the morning...

SFX: Gassass / Gassat


Interpretation: 

Akira: I'll be right back, I have to go to the toilet!

Rumi: Sure

Akira (thinking x 4): How is it possible that I... [imhikarucat: Akira using "ore".]

Akira: am so embarrassed about showing my figure?

Akira: Can I go shopping for another somewhere?

Akira: I can't go out swimming like this.

Aside: Smartphone... smartphone [ubo: I believe Akira is looking in her bag for a phone to call for help, and I can only assume it would be from Okabe-san, who seems to be her lifeline in such situations.]

Akira: !?

Akira: This...

Akira: I got this in the morning... [ubo: referring to the paper bag inside her carrying bag which was handed to her by her grandma]

SFX: *rustle*

ラッシュガードです。
着たまま海に入れます。

オレを男扱いするのは...

あれ?

それで泳ぐの?

うん!

下に水着
着てきたんだけど

やっぱり恥ずかしくて

そっかー


Machine translation:

Paper note: It is a rash guard. / It is a rush guard. Put it in the sea while wearing it.

Narration: To treat me as a man ... / It's...

Rumi: That?

Rumi: Do you swim? / So you're going to swim? 

Akira: Yup! / yes! 

Akira: I'm wearing a swimsuit below / I've been wearing a swimsuit underneath.

Akira: After all I was ashamed / I'm ashamed after all.

Rumi: Is that so / That's it.


Interpretation:

Paper note: Here is a rash guard. Wear it when you are at the beach. [ubo: A rashguard is like a waterproof shirt you wear at the beach to protect you from the elements, and from image search, it seems the version with a zipper is quite popular in Japan.]

Narration: Treating me like I'm a guy... [imhikarucat: Akira also using "ore" in this]

Rumi: Huh?

Rumi: So are you going to swim?

Akira: Yes!

Akira: I am wearing a swimsuit underneath.

Akira: But I found it embarrassing.

Rumi: Is that so.

Ubo's main replacements to hikarucat's work:

I often have to make judgement calls when I replace something hikarucat did. So for any non-trivial changes I make to things that I am not absolutely confident about, I will document them here, in case I was actually the one who was wrong.

* Replaced "Perhaps, I... Why is this really embarrassing to wear?" with "How is it possible that I... am so embarrassed about showing my figure?". Reason: The use of the word "kakkou" here seems to mean figure. Imhikarucat was more correct in using "perhaps" though, but I couldn't find a way to work it in, so I expressed it in a more casual English way of speaking.

* Replaced "Where did I buy it? Did I? I can't even swim anyway" with "Can I go shopping for another somewhere? I can't go out swimming like this." Reason: For the first part, the literal translation seems to be "Couldn't I go shopping somewhere" or something like that, and I filled in the "for another". For the second part, I believe I am more closely matching the literal translation.
