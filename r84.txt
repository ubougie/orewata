もーっお母さんとケンカなんて子どものすることだよー?

あ はい...

けど早く泳ぎたい気持ちわかるな

私もアキラと泳ぐの楽しみにしてたもん

あたしもーっ


Machine translation:

Little girl: Mom and fighting are things that children do, right? / Mom and fight is a child's thing, isn't it?

Akira: Oh, yes...

Rumi: But I don't know if I want to swim fast / But you know how hard it feels to swim fast.

Rumi: I also enjoyed swimming with Akira / I was looking forward to swimming with Akira, too.

Little girl: I'm sorry / Me too!


Interpretation:

Little girl: Fighting with mom is a childish thing to do right?

Akira: Ah, yes... [imhikarucat: She just fought with her mom last night lol]

Rumi: I don't know if I want to swim fast today

Rumi: Because I also want to swim with Akira.

Little girl: Me too!

[imhikarucat: I think Rumi thought Akira cannot swim fast because since elementary school, Akira would never swim in PE, not because she cannot swim but because she refused to wear the swimsuit at that time.]

[ubo: I am not entirely satisfied with this translation of what Rumi says. For example, with heavy handed interpretation, she might be saying "I don't think I want to do a lot of real swimming this time. I'd prefer to just play games in the water with Akira." Our "official" interpretation above is a lot closer to the literal though and is therefore is less likely to have strayed too far from the original meaning.]
