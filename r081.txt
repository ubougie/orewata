...
やっぱり女子だから料理好きなの?

アキラ

料理に男も女もないよ

だって食べないと死んじゃうもん

違うよ私が好きだから好きなんだよ


Machine Translation:

Tsukumo: ... Do you like cooking because you're a girl? / ... Are you a girl, so you like cooking?

Grandma (flashback): Akira

Grandma (flashback): There is no man or woman in cooking

Grandma (flashback): Because if you don't eat you will die

Akira: No / That's not right

Akira: I like it because I like it


Ubo and Imhikarucat's Interpretation:

Tsukumo: ... Do you like cooking because you're a girl?

Grandma (flashback): Akira

Grandma (flashback): There is no man or woman in cooking [imhikarucat: I think grandma is saying the kanji for "man" or "woman" are absent in the word for "cooking".]

Grandma (flashback): Because if you don't eat, you die.

Akira: You're wrong.

Akira: I like it just because.

いや...
その

あ...かっ

かっこいいな

?

さっきの!

Machine Translation:

Shoma: No ... / No... That

Shoma: Oh ... / Oh, my God. Kah

Shoma: cool / That's cool.

Akira: ?

Shoma: Just before! / Earlier!

SFX: Ha / Hah

Akira: I like it because I like it!


Ubo and Imhikarucat's Interpretation:

Shoma: Um, that...

Shoma: uh, that was...

Shoma: That was cool.

Akira: ?

Shoma: The thing you said earlier.

SFX: *gasp*

Akira (flashback): I like it just because. [ubo: interesting that the flashback uses ore instead of watashi; btw important to this I think is that in the bubble, it shows Shoma just behind her as she's talking. The text is there just to give context that he was overhearing them.]

聞かれてたんだ...!

恥ずかしい...!


Machine Translation:

Akira (thinking): I was asked ...!

Akira (thinking): embarrassed...!


Ubo and Imhikarucat's Interpretation:

Akira (thinking): He overheard us.

Akira (thinking): I'm so embarrassed...!


Imhikarucat's analysis of the bottom three portraits at the end of the release:

* Tsukumo's portrait: He was thinking about how Akira response to his question about cooking. Judging by his looks, he is curious about Akira.
* Erika's portrait: She might be jealous at Akira as Shoma kind of blew her off but then engaged in conversation with Akira.
* Shouma's portrait: It's Shoma, we all known his meh reaction over the course of the manga. He might be interested in Akira because he is the first boy to constantly trying to have a conversation with her. Or maybe, he is just a nice guy.
