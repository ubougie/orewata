Final version and publishing: Ubo

[Fun fact: I will start committing the different stages of the file individually in git, so if you'd like to see imhikarucat's translation before I replace it with my own, you can do so. It is entirely possible that I might, from time to time, replace a better translation with a worse one, though the ideal is that you never have to look at the history other than just for your own curiosity.]
