九十九くんシンデレラ役似合わないって言ってて

なんか昔の私みたいで...

力になりたいと思ったんだけど

仲を勘繰られるし

好きなの？

迷惑だって九十九くんを怒らせるかもしれない

今の私じゃ…

アキラ


Machine translation:

Akira: Kujuku-kun, saying that he doesn't suit Cinderella / Ninety-nine-kun Cinderella says it doesn't look good

Akira: It looks like old me ... / It's like I used to be.

Akira: I wanted to help / I wanted to help you.

Akira: I'm confused / We're going to get along.

Natsumi: I like it / What do you like?

Akira: May be annoying to offend Kujuku-kun / It might make Ninety-nine-kun angry, even if it's annoying.

Akira: For me now ... / I'm the one who's right now.

Rumi: Akira


Interpretation:

Akira: Tsukumo-kun told me that he doesn't suit Cinderella role

Akira: Things like that resembling my former self...

Akira: I think I want to help 

Akira: However, everyone seems to suspicious about our relationship

Natsumi: Do you like him?

Akira: Because (me being) annoyance might make Tsukumo-kun angry

Akira: For now, I think I will...

Rumi: Akira

すごいね

え?

私ずっと九十九くんはただの怖い人だと思ってたのに

アキラは仲良くなってるんだもん

ヤバイ時はコレ

私にはできないもんすごいよ

いや…本当たまたま

まだ何もできてないし

また失敗するかもしれないし

このままおとなしく…

でも助けになりたいんでしょ?


Machine translation:

Rumi: amazing / Amazing right

Akira: Huh? / What?

Rumi: I always thought that I was just a scary person / I've always thought that Ninety-nine-kun was just a scary person.

Rumi: Akira is getting along well / Akira's getting along.

Rumi: What i can't do / It's amazing what I can't do

Akira: No ... it just happened / No... It really happens.

Akira: Nothing can be done / I haven't done anything yet.

Akira: I might fail again

Akira: Keep calm as it is ... / Stay quiet...

Rumi: But do you want to help? / But you want to help, don't you?


Interpretation:

Rumi: Is amazing~ (Is amazing, don't you think)

Akira: Eh?

Rumi: I always thought Tsukumo-kun is a scary person 

Rumi: Meanwhile Akira is getting along well with him (Note: Rumi tend to talk with もん as final partical in a sentence. It sounds cute)

Sign: In moment of danger, press this (Litteral: In time of danger, here)

Rumi: I can't do that so it's really amazing (Rumi add もん in the end of a sentence here again)

Akira: No... Actually that just happened

Akira: I haven't done anything yet

Akira: Obviously I will fail again

Akira: Staying quiet like this

Rumi: Nevertheless, you still want to help isn't it?

すっ

やってみようよ


Machine translation:

SFX: So / Su

Rumi: Let's try / Let's do it.


Interpretation:

SFX: *slow movement*

Rumi: Let's try it (Let's do it) (I prefer try in this case since Rumi personality doesn't active as for example Aoi. And the SFX support that too)

Akira (thinking): As always, Rumi is...

Narration: Wonder if I can do it...? (Akira using ore here)

Akira: Thank you
