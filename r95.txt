OCR:

九十九くんシンデレラ役似合わないって言ってて

なんか昔の私みたいで...

力になりたいと思ったんだけど

仲を勘繰られるし

好きなの？

迷惑だって九十九くんを怒らせるかもしれない

今の私じゃ...

アキラ


Machine translation:

Akira: Kujuku-kun, saying that he doesn't suit Cinderella / Ninety-nine-kun Cinderella says it doesn't look good

Akira: It looks like old me ... / It's like I used to be.

Akira: I wanted to help / I wanted to help you.

Akira: I'm confused / We're going to get along.

Natsumi: I like it / What do you like?

Akira: May be annoying to offend Kujuku-kun / It might make Ninety-nine-kun angry, even if it's annoying.

Akira: For me now ... / I'm the one who's right now.

Rumi: Akira


Interpretation:

Akira: Tsukumo-kun says that he cannot suitably play the role of Cinderella.

Akira: It reminds me of how I used to be...

Akira: I wanted to help, but

Akira: everyone seems to be suspicious about our relationship

Natsumi: Do you like him?

Akira: and to make it worse, Tsukumo might get angry.

Akira: For now, I won't...

Rumi: Akira

すごいね

え?

私ずっと九十九くんはただの怖い人だと思ってたのに

アキラは仲良くなってるんだもん

[Tw2] SOS! ヤバイ時はコレ

[CW11] 「あぶない」と おもったら非常ボタン

私にはできないもんすごいよ

いや...本当たまたま

まだ何もできてないし / まだなにもできてないし

また失敗するかもしれないし

このままおとなしく...

でも助けになりたいんでしよ?


Machine translation:

Rumi: amazing / Amazing right

Akira: Huh? / What?

Rumi: I always thought that I was just a scary person / I've always thought that Ninety-nine-kun was just a scary person.

Rumi: Akira is getting along well / Akira's getting along.

[Tw2] Sign: SOS! This is a bad time / Sos! This is the time when I'm not good ejat.

[CW11] Sign: Emergency button if you think it's dangerous / Emergency button when you think "no blow"

Rumi: What i can't do / It's amazing what I can't do

Akira: No ... it just happened / No... It really happens.

Akira: Nothing can be done / I haven't done anything yet.

Akira: I might fail again

Akira: Keep calm as it is ... / Stay quiet...

Rumi: But do you want to help? / But you want to help, don't you?


Interpretation:

Rumi: You're amazing, aren't you.

Akira: Eh?

Rumi: I always thought that Tsukumo-kun was a scary person

Rumi: but Akira can get along with him!

[Tw2] Sign: SOS! In times of danger, press this.

[CW11] Sign: Emergency button for when there is grave danger.

Rumi: I definitely couldn't do it, so that's amazing!

Akira: No... it really just sort of happened. [ubo: same phrasing as was used on page 2 of the previous release with Natsumi]

Akira: I haven't done anything yet.

Akira: I may fail again

Akira: staying quiet like this...

Rumi: But you want to help, right?

[imhikarucat: A few times on this page, Rumi uses もん as the final particle in a sentence. It sounds cute.] [ubo: もん is a bit young and girlish sounding, and is like an emphatic "but" or "because", depending on context. Also, Akira has been using し, which in how it is used here is fairly informal and has maybe a rambling flavour to it.]
