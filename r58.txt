Machine translations:

Rumi: From today you can see Sailor Ah-chan every day! / You can see sailor clothes achan every day from today!

Akira: That's right ... / Let's see...

Akira: ...

Rumi: What happened? / What's wrong?

Akira: No

Akira: Nothing / It's nothing.

Rumi: Ah! Let's exchange mobile numbers! / Oh, my God! So let's exchange the number of the mobile phone!

Akira: Ah / Oh, my Go.

Akira: I'm sorry I forgot my smartphone ...

Rumi: What does that mean? / What doesn't that mean?


Interpretation:

Rumi: From today, I can see A-chan wearing sailor uniform everyday! (A-chan is for Akira-chan)

Akira: I guess so...

Akira: ...

Rumi: What's the matter?

Akira: No

Akira: Nothing

Rumi: Ah! That's right. We should exchange our phone contact! (Rumi using "denwa" as for "phone". A more traditional way) (I am using contact here even though the kanji is number because you can't exchange LINES contact would make more sense than if you forgot your phone but you can still share you phone number, unless you forgot those digits)

Akira: Ah

Akira: Sorry. I forgot to bring my phone... (While Akira using "sumaho" as for "smartphone" here. A loan word which sound modern, city like)

Rumi: What's that~? It doesn't mean anything (Rumi doesn't understand Akira using "sumaho" as "smartphone" here. Akira is a city kid got moved to grandma's house in rural area)
