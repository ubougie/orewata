SFX: *smile*

Erika: We went to the summer festival together!

Mayu: Ooh~

Erika: In such a crowded place, our hands almost touched!

Mayu: Eh!? You didn't hold hands?

Erika: That would be too embarrassing!

Akira (thinking): ... [ubo: Some speculation about this pause: it could be about the photo she is looking at, or about the conversation in general, but it could also be about how she experienced a crisis in the previous chapter about how she felt embarrassed in her bathing suit. Here's Erika expressing her own embarrassment about something, so she might be reflecting on that.]

Mayu: If that's your attitude, then somebody might steal him!

Erika: I don't want to seem too clingy!

Erika: Here we are doing our homework together!

Mayu: Oh〜

Mayu: Anything else?

Mayu: Ah.

[ubo: The finger says "Mayu" on it, to indicate that this was Mayu reaching up to touch the screen and swipe to look at the next image.]
