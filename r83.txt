Ubo's Interpretation:

Akira; I'm going to the beach tomorrow...

Akira's mom: You're going to swim? In a swimsuit?

Akira's mom: Are you OK? How will you manage?

Akira: I'm fine.

Akira's mom: This is so sudden... I have to go buy a swimsuit.

Akira: I already bought it.

Akira's mom: How are you going? I can give you a lift-- [ubo: the upcoming reaction is almost something you'd expect if your mom said you can't go, but I don't think she's saying that here.]

SFX: Bag / Ba

Akira (thinking): I was looking forward to it ...

SFX: Slapstick / Battabata

Akira (thinking): Good to say ...! / I shouldn't have told you...

Akira (thinking): Whatever you like / No matter what you like.

Ubo's Interpretation:

Akira and her mom: ......

SFX: *slide open* [ubo: I think what happened is she slammed the sliding door shut, but it bounced back and slid open again on its own, which would make this a funny moment for the reader.]

Akira (thinking): She's the worst.

SFX: *step*

Akira (thinking): I was so looking forward to it...

SFX: *stomp stomp*

Akira (thinking): I shouldn't have said anything.

Akira (thinking): No matter what I want to do

Akira (thinking): It's never any good.
