[ubo backstory: When I was getting in the swing of posting these files, I had assumed that the online service I was using would keep a copy of everything I posted, so I wouldn't need to keep a backup. I was wrong. That being said, this file is the only casualty, because fortunately I was able to look around and find a copy of all the other files.]
