なんであんなことで怒ったんだろう

今までの積み重ねを否定されたみたいで...

なんか…

おはよう！


Machine translation:

Akira (thinking): Why would you get angry at that / Why did you get angry about that?

Akira: (thinking): It looks like you ’ve been denied the stack up to now… / It seems to have been denied the accumulation up to now.

Akira (thinking): Something… / Sort of???

Rumi: Good morning! / Mornin!


Interpretation:

Akira (thinking): I wonder why I got angry about that.

Akira (thinking): It's like she won't acknowledge the build up of circumstances that have lead up to now. [ubo: fun fact: I spent 2 hours on translating this line, working with the help of a group of native Japanese speakers. This sentence was of dungeon boss calibre.]

Akira (thinking): Or something...

Rumi: Morning!
