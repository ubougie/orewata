あ!

ごめん

瑠海とはまだ前みたく話せてない


Machine Translation:

Rumi: Chiacos is nice / Chiakos i hope

Cheer squad: Shirogumi Faio !! / Shiragumi Fio!!

Rumi: Akira next year together ...

Rumi: Ah! / Oh, my God!

Rumi: Sorry

Narration: I haven't been able to talk with Bohai yet / I haven't been able to talk to Youkai yet.


Ubo's Interpretation:

Rumi: Cheerleading costumes are so nice.

Cheer squad: Shirogumi, you can do it!

Rumi: Akira, next year, together --

Rumi: Ah!

Rumi: Sorry.

Narration: I haven't been able to talk to Rumi yet. [ubo: I don't understand what this is trying to say, but it is something important I missed that Akira resolved to herself that she'd do back when she looked at herself in the mirror after staying at the hairdresser's house after school. Maybe someone could help me understand so I can follow along with the story better? In the meantime, my guess: to admit to Rumi that she was born a guy.]

Ubo's Interpretation:

Crowd 2: What do you think about A-cups? They're not impressive.

Crowd 3: Does Tsuda have C-cups?

Crowd 4: I don't think so.

Crowd 5: Right?
