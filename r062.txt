Rumi: Yup! / yes!

Shion: Is that Akira not coming? / Isn't That Akira coming?

Rumi: Ah-chan is not good at going together / Oh, I'm not good at going with you.

Rumi: Um

Shion: Huh? Akira won't come?

Rumi: A-chan don't like (prefer) to go together (Jisho define it as "not one's cup of tea; not one's favorite​" but "prefer" sounds too formal so I choose "like". However, this "like" is not similar to "like" in "好き" <- this is what I am concern when readers read this part)

Shion: Perhaps she hates me?

Akira (thinking): Annoying! Who is she!

Akira (thinking): Rumi should stays away from Miura!

SFX: *squeeze*

Aoi: Hi-yah

Akira: A... Ao-chan!

Aoi: That's bad, that's bad
