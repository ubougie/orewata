Machine translation:

SFX: Bob

Akira: Foo / Hoot

SFX: Toto / Tot

Title: Okabe

Okabe's message: what happened? / What's going on?

Akira's message (x 2): Is it strange that a man wants to cool a girl? / Is it strange that a man wants to be a girl?

Text above timestamp: Already read / Read as

Okabe's message: Akira is okay because she's cute! / Akira-chan is cute, so it's okay!!

SFX: Pilon / Piron


Interpretation:

SFX: *bounce*

Akira: Oof.

SFX: *tap tap*

Title: Okabe

Okabe's message: What's wrong?

Akira's message (x 2): Is it weird for a guy to think that he wants to be a girl?

Text above timestamp: Read [ubo: as in, "message read"]

Okabe's message: Akira-chan is cute, so it's alright!!

SFX: *incoming message sound* [ubo: literal sound is "piron", though in English that r might sound like a "d" like "peedon". This to my ear might be translated to something like bing-bong in English.]

かわいいから…

オレは

いろんな人に認めてもらえたけど

それって

もしかして

オレが...

女はいいよな


Machine translation:

Akira: because it's cute… / She's so cute.

Akira (thinking): I am / I'm

Akira (thinking): I was recognized by various people / I've been recognized by a lot of people.

Akira (thinking): that's / About that

Akira (thinking): Maybe / If

Akira (thinking): I ... / I'm...

Tsukumo (flashback): Woman is good


Interpretation:

Akira: "Because I'm cute"...

Akira (thinking): I was [I = "ore"]

Akira (thinking): accepted by many people, however...

Akira (thinking): So [ubo: I think this says "she said that", or more explicitly, Okabe said "Because Akira is cute", on the previous page]

Akira (thinking): Perhaps

Akira (thinking): I...

Tsukumo (flashback): It must be nice to be a girl [imhikarucat: this may perhaps be interpreted as "make for a good girl"]

[ubo: This page is highly speculative. I could explain to you all the things that make this page complex, and that might help you understand the structure of how everything flows on the page and maybe improve your understanding of what is going on a bit, but I won't bother because it is a real rabbit hole. Instead, with Tokiko's Fanpig's help, we have dispatched their Japanese friend to give us a better translation for this page, so feel free to come back to this file later and see if it has been updated with all the kinks worked out.]
