First draft: Imhikarucat
Final version and publishing: Ubo

Note from ubo: imhikarucat likes to point out when Akira uses "ore" instead of "watashi". I will stop including those. From this point forward, unless I say otherwise, Akira always uses "watashi" when speaking but always uses "ore" when thinking.

Machine translation:

Shouma: Fujimiya!

Shouma: Good morning / Mornin

Erika: Hi Shoma / Oss Shoma

Shouma: Oh, I thought Erina or someone / I thought it was Erihana or someone.

Erika: Terrible / Hidoi

Akira (thinking): I've only seen Ishii guys dating someone / I've only seen Ishii-san and his friends who are going out with him.

Akira (thinking): I'm sure you'll be happy ... / I'm sure you're happy. That's the case with Erihana.

Tsukumo: 0 @…

Akira (scream): End / Wow.

SFX: Pasic / Pasi


Interpretation:

Shouma: Fujimiya!

Shouma: Good morning.

Erika: Hi Shouma [imhikarucat: Erika greets Shouma really gyaru/trendy sound like here] [ubo: The expression "ossu" is short for "Ohayou gozaimaSU", and I would speculate is very similar to our own use of "sup". Somewhat masculine, but girls could say it too.]

Shouma: Eh? Aah Erika? I didn't recognize you.

Erika: How cruel!

Akira (thought): Ishii-san is the only one I've ever seen dating anyone.

Akira (thought): She sure seems happy... I'm sure the same will hold true for Erika...

Tsukumo: ...Um

Akira: Wah!

SFX: *slap*

Akira (thinking): why? / Why? Since when?

Akira (thinking): Is there anyone else who knows? / Is there anyone else you know?

Box: Girls

Natsumi: Roles will be assigned by a lottery.

Natsumi: Given that it seems boys are having a hard time volunteering.

SFX: *wheeze* [ubo: I don't understand why this sound effect is used. In my own mind I replace this with some kind of offended reaction from the boys in the class.]

魔女 水見

ママ母 菊池

姉A 中曽根

姉B 佐原


Machine translation:

Natsumi: Don't complain no matter what role you play

Natsumi: What role is Akira? / What's the role of Akira?

Board:
- Cinderella Ninety-nine
- Prince Fujimiya
- Witch Minami
- Mom mother Kikuchi / Mama Mother Kikuchi
- Sister A Nakasone
- Sister B Sahara / Sister B Sawara


Interpretation:

Natsumi: Don't complain no matter what role you get.

Natsumi: What role did you get Akira?

Board:
- Cinderella: Tsukumo
- Prince: Fujimiya [ubo: For those who don't remember her last name, this is Akira]
- Witch: Minami
- Mama (mother): Kikuchi
- Sister A: Nakasone
- Sister B: Sahara [ubo: The name is mostly clipped, but I'm just that good.]

[ubo: see file r092.png in this same directory to see headshots of each of these six people. The faces are in the same order as this list above, assuming you read the image from left to right, as in: 1, 2; 3, 4; 5, 6.]

[ubo: I rattled my brain to make this whole lottery thing make sense, and this is what I have come up with:
1) There are two boxes even though we only ever see one: one is for boys and one is for girls.
2) The roles listed on the board is longer than we see. The list on page 3 are still being written and on page 4 are cropped on the left.
3) Roles were already distributed across the two boxes so that there would be as many boy roles as boys and as many girl roles as girls.
4) I would guess many of these roles are probably crew roles, because there are a lot more students than there are acting roles (except maybe during the ball, from what I know of the story).
There is maybe another way to make this release make sense, but as long as there is one way to explain it, as I have, it doesn't have to be considered an oversight on the part of the artist. Hope this helps.]
