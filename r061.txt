オレは…もう女だから…女らしくしなきゃって…男子が好きなもの諦めなきゃって思ってたけど…

ちがうんだ

Machine translation:

Narration: I thought ... I'm already a woman ... I need to be feminine ... I thought I had to give up what I liked ... / I'm... She's already a woman, so... I have to be a woman. I thought I had to give up what boys liked.

Akira: It's different / No, no, no, no,

SFX: Gongon

Aoi: Let's watch this!

Akira: Yup! / yes!

Narration: I like it ...! / It's okay to like...!


Interpretation:

Narration: Because I am a girl... I need to be more feminine... So I thoght I have to give up what boy likes...

Akira: That's not true (In this Akira response, while Akira saying to Aoi that is not true. However, if you link this line to the whole page with narration, it means the narration (in this case is Akira thought) is denying the reality that being a girl doesn't mean you have to give up/dislike boys' hobby)

SFX: *rubbing rubbing*

Aoi: Let's watch this!

Akira: Yes!

Narration: It's okay to like...!
