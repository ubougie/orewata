Machine translation:

Akira: ...?

Rumi: What? / How?

Rumi: Does it look good? 

Akira (thinking): Not me

Akira: Yeah cute! / yes it's cute!

Rumi: Oh! / Oh, my God! Now

Rumi: How do I look?

Akira (thinking): She didn't put them on me.

Akira: Yup, it's cute! 

Rumi: Ah! Just now.

Rumi: You were thinking "you didn't put them on me" right?

Akira: Tha That's not...!

Rumi aside: Hehe, but Akira is not a cat, she's a dog!

Rumi (SFX): It's ok, it's ok.

Akira: ...sniff

Akira:  ...sniff~ [imhikarucat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJFU_Cbgzfg - don't ask me how researching for sfx kyun kyun can lead me to this song :D] [ubo: I can't find a proper translation for this sound (sniff is one of the few potential ones; growl was another), but given the font change, I would say that it is definitely some kind of pleasure or pleased dog sound, and that Akira resists but can't help but fall into the role by the end.]


Notes:

Chronologically, this takes place 4-5 months after where the story currently is. I would judge the story to be around October, but this side release takes place on February 22, ie. "Cat Day" in Japan, because of word play between the sound of 2 "ni" in 2/22, and the sound a cat makes, "nyan".

I would love for someone to remind me where the original version of the image in the thought bubble of page 1 is from. If I had to guess, it would be somewhere near Halloween on Hatsuki's twitter (either 2019 or 2018).

There is art of Akira wearing the coat from the bottom right of the first page here: https://twitter.com/hatukisu/status/1231495877488869376

There is art of Akira as a dog, which complements this release nicely, here: https://twitter.com/hatukisu/status/1226780259099402240
