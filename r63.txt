Teacher: Because of that...

SFX: *ring ring*

Akira: Rumi

SFX: *clattering*

Rumi: Ebi-chan (It's Erika nickname. Rumi is playing Kanji with Erika name here. This is not Hatsuki typo or Rumi mistake. This will playout later on in this release)

アキラってさ…うちらのこと友だちと思ってる?

おっ…思ってるよ!

じゃあなんで朝トイレ来なかったの?

昨日も知らないうちに帰るし

うちらのことどうでもいいと思ってるから黙って帰ったんでしょ

はぁ!?

知り合ったばかりのくせに勝手なこと言わないでよ!

私と瑠海は…!

ニッ

うちは知り合いなんだ

あっ!

じゃあお友達同士ちゃんと話し合った方がいいねー

スッ。。

Interpretation:

Shion: About Akira said... do you consider me as your friend?

Akira: Um... Of course I do!

Shion: Well then, why did you not come to the toilet with us this morning?

Shion: Yesterday, you go home without letting me know

Shion: I think you don't care about us so you went home silently

Akira: Huh!?

Shion: We merely know each others. Don't say something like that at your convenience (Don't say something as you like)

Akira: Me and Rumi are...

Shion: *grin*

Shion: You are just an acquaintance

Akira: Ah... (I think she knows what she have done to Rumi at this moment)

Shion: Well then, how about we discuss this properly with your fellow friends

SFX: *step*

あだ…?

Interpretation:

Akira: Rumi...

Rumi: Phone number...! You promised to give me first, didn't you? (Rumi was asked Akira her phone contact (release 61) on the first day of middle school but Akira replied that she forgot her phone. This morning (release 62) Aoi asked Akira her phone contact and Akira said out loud that this is the first time she give someone her phone contact, which Rumi overheard it. I would also sad if my bff give her contact to someone else first after promised to me) 

Akira: Ah...

Rumi: Did you enjoy playing cards with Fujiki-san? You sorry? I won't accept that

Akira: That's n... That's not...

Rumi: Now now, take it easy. You called Fujiki-san by her nickname while you have never done that to me (Yes, Akira indeed called Aoi chan as Ao while she never called Rumi by her nickname once. Maybe Rumin sounds cute)

Akira: Huh...?
